# My online library
The website 'My online library' allows us to fill out a form in order to add a book to our library with the following parameters:
* the title of the book
* the name of the author
* the status: plan to read or already read

We can consult, modify the status of the book we have added in our library, as well as completely remove it.
## Goal
The main goal of this website is to practice the class manipulation as well as the responsiveness of the different containers.
